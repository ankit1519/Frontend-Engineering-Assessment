## Notes

- The validation in the sign-up and login forms is basic and client-side. In a real-world scenario, you would implement more robust server-side validation and secure authentication.

- Adjust the design, styles, and functionalities based on your project requirements.

- This is a front-end only example. In a production environment, you would typically have a back-end server handling user authentication and data storage.
